### 2.5 CTA Copy Guidelines

**Action-Oriented Verbs:**
- GET (Get Service Now, Get Quote, Get Started)

- SCHEDULE (Schedule Service, Schedule Consultation)
- START (Start Your Project)
- APPLY (Apply Now)
- VIEW (View Open Positions, View Projects)

**Avoid Generic CTAs:**
- ❌ "Learn More" (vague, no action implied)

- ❌ "Submit" (button label, not CTA)
- ✅ "Request Fuel System Quote"
- ✅ "Schedule Emergency Service"
- ✅ "Start Your Project"

## 3. Form Design Philosophy

### 3.1 Core Principles

**1. Minimize Friction at Every Step**
- Fewest fields possible (question necessity of each field)
- Multi-step over single long form (reduce intimidation)
- Smart defaults and auto-fill (reduce typing)
- Clear labels and placeholders (reduce confusion)

**2. Progressive Disclosure**
- Capture email FIRST (enables abandonment recovery)
- Ask qualifying questions SECOND (route to right team)
- Collect contact details THIRD (only after commitment shown)
- Optional fields LAST (don't block submission)

**3. Build Trust Throughout**
- Privacy statement visible ("We'll never share your information")
- Response time commitment ("We'll respond within 4 hours")
- Security indicators (SSL badge, "Secure form" text)
- Progress indicator (show "Step 2 of 3")

**4. Mobile-First Design**
- Large touch targets (minimum 44x44px)
- Single-column layout (no side-by-side fields)
- Auto-focus on first field (reduce taps)
- Native input types (tel, email, date pickers)
- Sticky submit button (always accessible)

**5. Intelligent Validation**
- Inline validation (immediate feedback)
- Helpful error messages (not just "Invalid")
- Format examples in placeholder ("555-123-4567")
- Success indicators (green checkmark on valid input)

---

### 3.2 Form Field Best Practices

#### Required vs. Optional Fields Philosophy

- Name (first name minimum, full name preferred)

**Optional Fields (Nice-to-Have):**
- Company name
- Address (unless service requires site visit)
- Budget range (useful but may deter if too low)

## 5. Routing & Lead Assignment

### 5.1 Automatic Branch Assignment Logic

**Geographic Routing (Based on Location Field):**

Branch routing is automatic based on city/state input in quote/service request forms.

**Branch Service Areas:**

1. **Spokane, WA** (Eastern WA, Northern ID)
   - Washington: Spokane, Spokane Valley, Cheney, Liberty Lake
   - Idaho: Coeur d'Alene, Post Falls, Hayden, Moscow, Lewiston
   - Coverage radius: ~150 miles

2. **Portland, OR** (Western OR, SW WA)
   - Oregon: Portland, Salem, Eugene, Corvallis, Bend
   - Washington: Vancouver, Longview, Camas
   - Coverage radius: ~150 miles

3. **Boise, ID** (Southern ID, Eastern OR)
   - Idaho: Boise, Meridian, Nampa, Twin Falls, Idaho Falls
   - Oregon: Ontario, Baker City
   - Coverage radius: ~200 miles

4. **Kalispell, MT** (Headquarters - Northwest MT)
   - Montana: Kalispell, Whitefish, Columbia Falls, Libby
   - Coverage radius: ~100 miles

5. **Billings, MT** (Central/Eastern MT)
   - Montana: Billings, Missoula, Great Falls, Bozeman, Helena
   - Coverage radius: ~250 miles (largest territory)

6. **Fresno, CA** (Central CA)
   - California: Fresno, Visalia, Clovis, Madera, Hanford
   - Coverage radius: ~100 miles

7. **Bakersfield, CA** (Southern Central CA)
   - California: Bakersfield, Delano, Taft, Tehachapi
   - Coverage radius: ~75 miles

8. **San Jose, CA** (Bay Area, Northern CA)

   - Coverage radius: ~150 miles

9. **Springdale, AR** (Northwest AR)
   - Arkansas: Springdale, Fayetteville, Bentonville, Rogers, Fort Smith
   - Coverage radius: ~100 miles

**Fallback Routing:**
- If city/state doesn't match exact coverage area: Calculate zip code distance to all branches
- Assign to nearest branch by driving distance (not straight-line)
- Display: "Your request will be handled by our [Nearest Branch] branch, approximately [X miles] from your location"

## 7. Mobile Conversion Optimization

### 7.1 Mobile User Behavior Insights

**Mobile Traffic Assumptions (Industry Data):**
- 60-70% of website traffic is mobile
- 40-50% of form submissions are mobile
- Mobile users have 25% lower conversion rates than desktop (if not optimized)
- Field personnel (technicians, operators) use phones primarily

**Mobile User Context:**
- On-the-go: At job site, in vehicle, during crisis
- Thumb-typing: One-handed input common
- Shorter attention span: Need to complete task quickly
- Network variability: May have slow connection
- Smaller screen: Less context visible at once

**Mobile Optimization Goal:**
- Match or exceed desktop conversion rates
- Reduce mobile form completion time to under 4 minutes
- Minimize scrolling and zoom requirements
- Enable one-handed operation where possible

---

### 7.2 Mobile-First Design Principles

**Layout:**
- Single-column forms (no side-by-side fields)
- Full-width input fields (edge-to-edge with padding)
- Large touch targets (minimum 44x44px, prefer 56x56px)
- Generous spacing between fields (16px minimum)
- Sticky submit button (always accessible, no scrolling to submit)

**Input Optimization:**
- Native keyboard types:
  - `type="email"` → Email keyboard with @ symbol
  - `type="tel"` → Numeric keypad
  - `type="number"` → Number keyboard
  - `type="date"` → Native date picker
  - `type="url"` → URL keyboard with .com key
- Auto-focus first field (reduce taps)
- Auto-advance on completion (e.g., phone number → next field)
- Format as user types (phone: (555) 123-4567)

**Validation:**
- Inline validation (immediate feedback, no page refresh)
- Error messages below field (not tooltip or modal)
- Success indicators (green checkmark when valid)
- Highlight field border (red for error, green for success)

**Form Submission:**
- Disable submit button during processing (prevent double-submit)
- Show loading spinner: "Submitting your request..."
- No page navigation (AJAX submit if possible)
- Success confirmation on same page (no redirect)

- Primary CTA: Full-width, blue, 56px height
- Secondary CTA: Full-width, outline, 56px height, 16px spacing above
- Tertiary CTA: Centered text link with phone icon, 24px spacing above

**Floating Action Button (FAB) - Optional Enhancement:**
- Position: Bottom-right corner, 64x64px
- Icon: Phone or lightning bolt
- Color: Green (phone) or Blue (service)
- Action: Opens primary CTA modal or click-to-call

- Improve Step 2 → Step 3: 75% → 80% (branch assignment trust signal)

---

### 8.3 Form Abandonment Analysis

**Abandonment Tracking:**

For each form, track:
- **Field-level abandonment**: Which field do users exit on?
- **Time-based abandonment**: How long before users give up?
- **Step-based abandonment**: Which multi-step form step has highest drop-off?

**Example Report:**

**Quote Request Form Abandonment (Last 30 Days):**

| Exit Point | Abandonment Rate | Volume | Insights |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| Step 1: Service Type dropdown | 15% | 63 | Dropdown too long? Add search/filter |
| Step 1: Email field | 10% | 42 | Privacy concern? Add trust signals |
| Step 2: Phone number | 12% | 36 | Remove format validation? |
| Step 2: Company name | 5% | 15 | Make optional |
| Step 3: Description textarea | 8% | 17 | Min. character requirement too high? |
| Step 3: Budget dropdown | 3% | 6 | Good - optional field |

**Optimization Actions:**
- If abandonment >10% on required field: Consider making optional
- If abandonment on Step 1: Reduce fields to 1-2 minimum
- If abandonment on optional field: Consider removing entirely
- If abandonment on submit button: Add trust signal before button

---

### 8.4 Google Analytics 4 Implementation

**GA4 Event Structure:**

All form events should follow this structure:

```javascript
gtag('event', 'form_start', {
  'event_category': 'Forms',
  'event_label': 'Quote Request Form',
  'form_type': 'quote_request',
  'page_url': window.location.href,
  'timestamp': new Date().toISOString()
});
```

**Form Tracking Implementation:**

```javascript
// Track form start (first field interaction)
document.querySelector('form#quote-request').addEventListener('focusin', function(e) {
  if (!this.dataset.formStarted) {
    gtag('event', 'form_start', {
      'form_type': 'quote_request',
      'form_name': 'Quote Request Form'
    });
    this.dataset.formStarted = 'true';
  }
}, { once: true });

// Track step completion
document.querySelector('#step1-next-btn').addEventListener('click', function() {
  gtag('event', 'form_step_complete', {
    'form_type': 'quote_request',
    'step_number': 1,
    'step_name': 'Service Selection'
  });
});

// Track form submission
document.querySelector('form#quote-request').addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
  gtag('event', 'form_submit', {
    'form_type': 'quote_request',
    'service_type': document.querySelector('#service-type').value,
    'timeline': document.querySelector('#timeline').value,
    'location': document.querySelector('#city').value + ', ' + document.querySelector('#state').value
  });
});

// Track successful submission (after AJAX response)
// Trigger this in success callback
gtag('event', 'form_submit_success', {
  'form_type': 'quote_request',
  'lead_id': response.lead_id,
  'assigned_branch': response.branch_name
});
```

---

### 8.5 CRM Analytics Integration

**Lead Source Tracking:**

Capture UTM parameters and referrer information on form submission:

```javascript
// Capture on page load
var leadSource = {
  utm_source: getUrlParameter('utm_source'),
  utm_medium: getUrlParameter('utm_medium'),
  utm_campaign: getUrlParameter('utm_campaign'),
  utm_term: getUrlParameter('utm_term'),
  utm_content: getUrlParameter('utm_content'),
  referrer: document.referrer,
  landing_page: window.location.href
};

// Store in hidden fields or session storage
sessionStorage.setItem('leadSource', JSON.stringify(leadSource));

// Send to CRM on form submission
fetch('/api/leads', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    ...formData,
    ...leadSource
  })
});
```

**CRM Dashboard Metrics:**

Track these metrics in CRM reporting dashboard:

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Lead Volume | Total form submissions per month | 250+ |
| Lead Response Time | Time from submission to first contact | <4 hours (P2), <1 hour (P1) |
| Lead-to-Qualified Rate | % of leads qualified as sales-ready | >50% |
| Qualified-to-Quote Rate | % of qualified leads receiving quote | >80% |
| Quote-to-Win Rate | % of quotes converting to projects | >25% |
| Overall Conversion Rate | % of form submissions converting to customers | >10% |

---

### 8.6 A/B Test Tracking

**Test Tracking Structure:**

For every A/B test, track:
- Variant assignment (which version user saw)
- Conversion event (did they complete goal?)
- Statistical significance (is result meaningful?)

**Example A/B Test:**

**Test:** Hero headline variation
**Variants:**
- A (Control): "Maximize Your Uptime. Minimize Downtime."
- B (Variant): "Keep Your Stations Running. Keep Your Customers Happy."

**Tracking Code:**

```javascript
// Assign variant (50/50 split)
var variant = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'A' : 'B';
sessionStorage.setItem('heroHeadline_variant', variant);

// Track variant view
gtag('event', 'experiment_view', {
  'experiment_name': 'hero_headline_test',
  'variant': variant
});

// Track conversion (form submission)
gtag('event', 'form_submit', {
  'experiment_name': 'hero_headline_test',
  'variant': variant
});
```

**Report:**
| Variant | Views | Form Submits | Conversion Rate | Statistical Significance |
|---------|-------|-------------|----------------|------------------------|
| A (Control) | 5,000 | 1,015 | 20.3% | Baseline |
| B (Variant) | 5,000 | 1,125 | 22.5% | 95% confidence, p<0.05 ✓ |

**Decision:** Implement Variant B (2.2% lift in conversion rate)

---

## 9. Thank You Page Strategy

### 9.1 Confirmation Page Purpose

**Goals of Thank You Page:**
1. Confirm submission was successful (reduce anxiety)
2. Set expectations for next steps (when will they hear back?)
3. Provide alternative contact methods (phone, email)
4. Continue engagement (related content, resources)
5. Build trust (introduce team member, show process)
6. Enable sharing/referral (social proof opportunity)

**What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Generic "Thank you" with no details
- ❌ Dead end (no further actions)
- ❌ Redirect to homepage (loses context)
- ❌ No indication of what happens next

---

## 10. A/B Testing Roadmap

### 10.1 Test Prioritization Framework

**ICE Scoring (Impact, Confidence, Ease):**

Rate each test on scale of 1-10:
- **Impact**: How much will this improve conversion rate?
- **Confidence**: How confident are we this will work?
- **Ease**: How easy is it to implement?

**ICE Score = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3**

**Priority Order:**
- Score 8-10: Test immediately (high priority)
- Score 6-7.9: Test within 1 month (medium priority)
- Score <6: Test eventually or skip (low priority)

---

### 10.2 High-Priority Tests (Launch Within 30 Days)

#### Test 1: Hero Headline Variation

**Hypothesis:** Pain-point focused headline will convert better than benefit-focused headline

**Current (Control):**
"Maximize Your Uptime. Minimize Downtime."

**Variant B:**
"One Partner for All Your Fuel & Car Wash Needs"

**Success Metric:** Form submission rate (quote requests)
**Sample Size:** 5,000 visitors per variant
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**ICE Score:** 9.0 (Impact: 9, Confidence: 9, Ease: 9)

---

#### Test 2: CTA Button Color

**Control:** Nwestco Blue (#25617C)
**Variant A:** Nwestco Green (#709944)
**Variant B:** High-Contrast Orange (#FF6B35)

**Success Metric:** CTA click-through rate

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**ICE Score:** 8.7 (Impact: 8, Confidence: 9, Ease: 9)

---

**Sample Size:** 1,000 form starts per variant
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks

---

**Hypothesis:** Testimonial above quote form will increase form starts

**Control:** No testimonial near form
**Variant:** Customer testimonial directly above form with photo

**Success Metric:** Form start rate
**Sample Size:** 2,000 visitors per variant
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**ICE Score:** 8.3 (Impact: 8, Confidence: 8, Ease: 9)

---

#### Test 5: Response Time Messaging

**Hypothesis:** Specific response time ("4 hours") will increase form submissions vs. generic ("soon")

**Control:** "We'll respond soon"
**Variant A:** "We'll respond within 4 hours"
**Variant B:** "We'll call you within 4 hours during business hours"

**Success Metric:** Form submission rate
**Sample Size:** 2,000 visitors per variant
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**ICE Score:** 8.0 (Impact: 8, Confidence: 8, Ease: 8)

---

### 10.3 Medium-Priority Tests (30-60 Days Post-Launch)

#### Test 6: Mobile CTA Style (Button vs. FAB)

**Hypothesis:** Floating Action Button (FAB) on mobile will increase conversions

**Control:** Sticky header CTA only
**Variant:** Sticky header + FAB in bottom-right corner

**Success Metric:** Mobile form submission rate
**Sample Size:** 3,000 mobile visitors per variant
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**ICE Score:** 7.7 (Impact: 8, Confidence: 7, Ease: 8)

---

#### Test 7: Trust Signal Prominence

**Hypothesis:** Client logos above the fold will increase time on site and conversions

**Control:** Client logos in mid-page section
**Variant:** Client logos immediately below hero (above the fold)

**Success Metric:** Time on site + form submission rate
**Sample Size:** 3,000 visitors per variant
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**ICE Score:** 7.3 (Impact: 7, Confidence: 7, Ease: 8)

---

#### Test 8: Video Testimonial vs. Text

**Hypothesis:** Video testimonial will be more engaging and increase conversions

**Control:** Text testimonial with photo
**Variant:** 30-second video testimonial

**Success Metric:** Engagement (video play rate) + form submissions
**Sample Size:** 2,000 visitors per variant
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**ICE Score:** 7.0 (Impact: 8, Confidence: 7, Ease: 6)

---

### 10.4 Low-Priority Tests (60-90 Days Post-Launch)

#### Test 9: Branch Assignment Visibility

**Hypothesis:** Showing assigned branch early in form will build trust and increase completion

**Control:** Branch assigned after form submission
**Variant:** Branch displayed after Step 1 (location entered)

**Success Metric:** Form completion rate
**Sample Size:** 1,000 form starts per variant
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**ICE Score:** 6.7 (Impact: 7, Confidence: 7, Ease: 6)

---

#### Test 10: Exit-Intent Modal

**Hypothesis:** Exit-intent modal offering to save progress will reduce abandonment

**Control:** No exit-intent detection
**Variant:** Modal: "Don't lose your progress! Enter email to save."

**Success Metric:** Form abandonment rate + email capture rate
**Sample Size:** 1,000 form starts per variant
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**ICE Score:** 6.3 (Impact: 7, Confidence: 6, Ease: 6)

---

### 10.5 A/B Testing Best Practices

**Test One Variable at a Time:**
- Don't change headline AND button color simultaneously
- Isolate variables to understand what caused change

**Statistical Significance:**
- Minimum 95% confidence level before declaring winner
- Use calculator: https://www.optimizely.com/sample-size-calculator/
- Don't end test early based on "looks like it's winning"

**Test Duration:**
- Run for at least 1 full week (accounts for day-of-week variance)
- Ideally 2-3 weeks for higher confidence
- If seasonal business, run for full business cycle

**Sample Size:**
- Minimum 100 conversions per variant (more for small lifts)
- For 5% baseline conversion rate, need ~2,000 visitors per variant
- Calculator: https://vwo.com/ab-split-test-duration/

**Document Everything:**
- Hypothesis (what you expect to happen)
- Variants (exact copy/design of each)
- Success metric (what you're measuring)
- Results (winning variant, lift %, significance)
- Learnings (why it worked or didn't)

**Implementation:**
- Use tool like Google Optimize, Optimizely, or VWO
- OR implement server-side A/B testing
- Ensure no "flicker" effect on page load
- Track variant in analytics for post-test analysis

## Summary & Expected Impact

### Conversion Strategy Overview

This comprehensive conversion strategy addresses five primary conversion goals with tailored approaches for each:

1. **Emergency Service Requests**: Minimal friction, 3-field form, red CTA, 10-minute callback commitment
2. **Quote Requests**: Multi-step form (3 steps), progressive qualification, 4-hour response commitment
3. **Service Requests**: Simple 1-2 step form, existing customer focus, 24-hour response
4. **Career Applications**: Mobile-friendly, 2-3 steps, 1-week review commitment
5. **Training Registrations**: 2-step process, course details prominent, immediate confirmation

### Key Differentiators

**Multi-Step Form Design:**
- Expected 30-50% improvement in completion rates vs. single long form
- Email capture in Step 1 enables save-and-resume
- Progressive disclosure reduces intimidation
- Better mobile experience (one screen per step)

**Smart Routing System:**
- Automatic branch assignment based on location
- Priority-based response commitments (P1: 10 min, P2: 4 hours, P3: 24 hours)
- Escalation workflow if SLA missed

**Trust Signal Strategy:**
- Client logos, testimonials, case studies throughout
- Personal introductions (photos, names, direct contact)
- Response time commitments (specific, not vague)
- Security indicators (SSL, privacy policy)

**Mobile-First Approach:**
- 60-70% of traffic is mobile (field personnel)
- Large touch targets (56px minimum)
- Native keyboard types (email, tel, number)
- Sticky CTAs and submit buttons
- Click-to-call always accessible

### Expected Improvements

| Metric | Baseline (Assumed) | Target | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| Homepage → Quote Form | 15% | 22% | +47% |
| Quote Form Completion | 30% | 45% | +50% |
| Mobile Form Completion | 20% | 30% | +50% |
| Emergency Capture Rate | 40% | 60% | +50% |
| Overall Lead Volume | 150/month | 250/month | +67% |
