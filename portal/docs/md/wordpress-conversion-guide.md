# WordPress Conversion Guide

## What Happens After You Select a Prototype

Once you've selected your preferred design direction, the prototype will be converted into a fully functional WordPress website. This document explains what to expect during that process and how the design may evolve.

## The Conversion Process

### Phase 1: Design Refinement
Before development begins, we'll refine the selected prototype based on your feedback:
- Incorporate requested changes from prototype review
- Finalize color adjustments, typography, and spacing
- Confirm content hierarchy and page structure
- Lock in navigation and user flow

### Phase 2: WordPress Development
The approved design is then built as a custom WordPress theme:
- Custom theme development (not a modified template)
- Responsive design implementation
- Content management system setup
- Form integrations and functionality

### Phase 3: Content Migration & Testing
- Migrate verified content from prototypes
- Client provides/approves fabricated content replacements
- Cross-browser and device testing
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Launch Preparation
- SEO setup and redirects
- Analytics integration
- Final client review
- Go-live and monitoring

## How the Design May Change

> **Important:** The final WordPress site will closely match the prototype, but some elements may look or behave slightly differently. This is normal and expected.

### Spacing & Proportions
- Prototype uses fixed pixel values; WordPress uses responsive units
- Spacing may adjust slightly across different screen sizes
- Some elements may reflow differently on tablets vs. desktop

### Typography
- Font rendering varies between browsers
- Line heights and letter spacing may need fine-tuning
- Heading sizes may adjust for better responsiveness

### Interactive Elements
| Prototype | WordPress |
|-----------|-----------|
| CSS-only animations | May use JavaScript for better performance |
| Hover effects | Will include touch-friendly alternatives |
| Carousels/sliders | Plugin-based with additional options |
| Form styling | Will match but include validation states |

### Images & Media
- Placeholder images replaced with real photography
- WordPress will auto-generate multiple image sizes
- Video backgrounds may have mobile fallbacks for performance
- Lazy loading added for page speed

### Navigation
- Mobile menu behavior may differ slightly
- Dropdown timing and animations refined for usability
- Mega menus (if applicable) optimized for touch devices

---

## What Will Stay the Same

These core elements will match the approved prototype:

- **Overall look and feel** - Colors, fonts, brand personality
- **Page layouts** - Section order, content hierarchy
- **Navigation structure** - Menu items, page organization
- **Key design elements** - Hero treatments, card styles, buttons
- **User experience** - How visitors flow through the site

---

## WordPress-Specific Additions

The WordPress site will include functionality not present in the prototypes:

### Content Management
- Easy-to-use admin interface for updating content
- Media library for images and documents
- User roles (admin, editor, etc.)

### Forms & Integrations
- Working contact forms with email notifications
- CRM integration (if applicable)
- Spam protection (reCAPTCHA or similar)
- Form submission tracking

### SEO & Analytics
- SEO plugin (Yoast or similar) for meta tags
- XML sitemap generation
- Google Analytics integration
- Search Console setup

### Performance & Security
- Caching for faster load times
- SSL certificate (HTTPS)
- Regular security updates
- Automated backups

### ClearCompany Integration
- Full integration with existing ClearCompany account
- Virtual Recruiter chatbot fully functional
- Job listings automatically synced
- Apply buttons working correctly

## Common Questions

### "Why can't it look exactly like the prototype?"
The prototype is a static HTML/CSS representation. WordPress is a dynamic system that needs to:
- Work across all browsers and devices
- Allow non-technical users to edit content
- Load quickly on slow connections
- Handle various content lengths gracefully

These requirements sometimes mean small visual adjustments for the greater good of usability and performance.

### "What if I don't like a change?"
We'll review the WordPress build with you before launch. If something doesn't match your expectations, we'll work together to find a solution that balances design fidelity with technical best practices.

### "How much can I edit myself?"
You'll be able to edit:
- Page text and headings
- Images and media
- Blog posts/news items
- Basic page layouts (within the design system)

You'll need developer support for:
- Adding new page templates
- Structural layout changes
- New functionality or integrations
- Design system changes (colors, fonts, etc.)

### "What about future updates?"
WordPress sites require ongoing maintenance:
- WordPress core updates (security)
- Plugin updates
- Theme compatibility checks
- Regular backups

We can discuss maintenance plans as part of the project scope.

## Timeline Expectations

| Phase | Typical Duration |
|-------|------------------|
| Design refinement | 1-2 weeks |
| WordPress development | 3-4 weeks |
| Content migration | 1-2 weeks |
| Testing & revisions | 1-2 weeks |
| **Total** | **6-10 weeks** |

*Actual timeline depends on project scope, feedback turnaround, and content readiness.*

## Next Steps After Selection

1. **Confirm your prototype choice** - Let us know which direction you prefer
2. **Provide feedback** - Note any changes you'd like before development
3. **Content preparation** - Start gathering real content to replace placeholders (see Content Accuracy Report)
4. **Kick-off meeting** - Align on timeline, milestones, and responsibilities
