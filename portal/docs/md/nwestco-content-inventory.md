### Content Assessment

| Element | Current Quality | Recommendation | Priority |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Hero Headline | Poor - Generic, doesn't explain what company does | REWRITE - "Maximize Uptime for Fuel Systems & Car Washes" | HIGH |
| Hero Subhead | Weak - "Design, Permit, Build" unclear | REWRITE - Pain-point focused copy | HIGH |
| Service Grid | Confusing - 8 categories with unclear relationships | ELIMINATE - Replace with 3-5 clear pillars | HIGH |
| Three Pillars | Generic - Could apply to any company | REWRITE - Use "Three Uniques" differentiators | HIGH |

| Metrics | Non-functional placeholders | ELIMINATE or REPLACE with real numbers | HIGH |
| Trust Signals | Missing entirely | ADD - Client logos, testimonials, certifications | HIGH |

### SEO Considerations
- Page title too generic, needs target keywords
- Missing meta description
- H1 likely "24/7 Service from Nwestco" - should be "Fuel Systems & Car Wash Equipment | Western US"
- No schema markup detected

### Strategic Alignment
- Does NOT communicate company scale ($120M)
- Does NOT position for acquisition targets or investors
- Does NOT support talent recruitment
- Does NOT differentiate from competitors

### Content Reuse Opportunities
- "48 hour service completion" stat - keep and feature prominently
- "Northwest" geographic mention - expand to "6 states, 9 branches"
- Turn-key messaging - keep but strengthen

### 3. Automotive Services (/services/automotive/)

**URL:** `https://nwestco.com/services/automotive/`

**Primary Headline:** [Needs verification]

**Key Messages:**

- "Factory trained on proper installation, maintenance practices and warranty procedures"

**Product Categories:**

- Facility lighting
- Lubrication equipment
- Bulk oil storage and delivery systems

**Content Assessment:**

| Element | Current State | Recommendation | Priority |
|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Strategic Clarity | CONFUSED - Is this auto repair shops or gas station automotive bays? | CRITICAL DECISION NEEDED | CRITICAL |
| Relationship to Petroleum | Overlap creates confusion | CONSOLIDATE into Fuel Systems or eliminate | HIGH |
| Product List | Clear, comprehensive | If kept: KEEP product list structure | MEDIUM |
| Target Audience | Unclear | CLARIFY - Auto repair shops? C-store automotive bays? Both? | CRITICAL |
| Factory Training | Good credential | KEEP - Supports technical expertise | MEDIUM |
| CTAs | Missing | ADD if page kept | MEDIUM |

**Strategic Questions:**
1. Is this vertical serving SEPARATE automotive repair shops, or is it automotive equipment FOR gas stations/c-stores?
2. If separate auto repair vertical, does this align with company strategy (focus on Fuel + Car Wash)?
3. Should this be consolidated into Petroleum as "Automotive Service Equipment for C-Stores"?

**Recommendation:**
**CONSOLIDATE into Fuel Systems vertical** as "C-Store Automotive Services" sub-category. If automotive repair shops are separate target market, keep as standalone but clarify distinction.

**Keep/Rewrite/Eliminate:**
- DECIDE: Strategic role of this vertical before content work
- REWRITE: If kept, clarify target audience immediately
- CONSOLIDATE: Likely merge into Fuel Systems if it's c-store automotive bays
- KEEP: Product categories and factory training mention

- "Above/underground tank options"
- "Av gas, Jet-A, standard gasoline, and diesel for ground equipment"

**Target Markets:**
- Regional airports
- Fixed Base Operators (FBOs)
- Private runways

**Content Assessment:**

| Element | Current State | Recommendation | Priority |
|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Content Volume | Very brief, minimal detail | ADD substantial content or CONSOLIDATE | HIGH |
| Strategic Clarity | Clear niche market | KEEP as specialty but expand or merge | MEDIUM |
| Technical Detail | Minimal | ADD tank specs, fuel types, compliance requirements | MEDIUM |
| Project Examples | None | ADD - Airport projects with photos if available | HIGH |
| Relationship to Petroleum | Essentially aviation fueling = petroleum subset | CONSOLIDATE into Fuel Systems as "Aviation Fueling" | HIGH |
| Target Market | Clear and specific | KEEP - airports, FBOs clearly defined | LOW |

**Recommendation:**
**CONSOLIDATE into Fuel Systems vertical** as "Aviation Fueling" sub-category. Aviation fueling uses same technical expertise as retail petroleum, just different application.

**Proposed Structure:**
```
Fuel Systems
├── Retail Fuel (Gas Stations, C-Stores)
├── Commercial/Fleet Fueling (Bulk plants, Marinas)
├── Aviation Fueling (Airports, FBOs) ← This page's content

**Product Lines:**
- LSI Lighting Systems (LED canopy/soffit for petroleum)

- Honeywell (building controls for coolers, HVAC, lighting, POS)

**Content Assessment:**

| Element | Current State | Recommendation | Priority |
|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Strategic Position | MISPLACED - Electrical is a SERVICE TYPE, not a market vertical | REORGANIZE - Position as capability, not vertical | CRITICAL |
| Technical Detail | Excellent - specific capabilities and products | KEEP all technical content | HIGH |
| Emergency Response | Good callout - 24/7 availability | KEEP and feature prominently | MEDIUM |
| Certifications | Master/Journeyman hierarchy shown | KEEP - Shows professionalism and scale | MEDIUM |
| Cross-Vertical Application | Implied but not stated | CLARIFY - "We provide electrical for ALL our services" | HIGH |

**Strategic Insight:**
Electrical is a CAPABILITY that applies across all market verticals:
- Petroleum projects need electrical (fuel dispensers, lighting, controls)
- Car wash projects need electrical (equipment wiring, lighting)
- Industrial projects need electrical (pump controls, monitoring systems)

**Recommendation:**
**REPOSITION as cross-cutting service capability**, not standalone vertical.

**Proposed Structure:**

**Option A - Eliminate as Navigation Item:**
- Feature electrical capabilities WITHIN each market vertical page
- "Our in-house Master Electricians handle all wiring, controls, and lighting"
- Link to detailed electrical capabilities page from each market vertical

**Option B - Keep as "Services We Provide" (Lifecycle):**
```
Services We Provide
├── Design & Engineering
├── Installation & Construction
├── Electrical Systems ← This page
├── 24/7 Service & Maintenance
├── Upgrades & Remodels
└── Compliance & Testing
```

**Keep/Rewrite/Eliminate:**
- KEEP: All technical capabilities, product lines, certifications
- KEEP: 24/7 emergency response callout
- REORGANIZE: From "market vertical" to "service capability"
- REWRITE: Frame as "We handle electrical so you don't need separate contractor"

### 6. Industrial Services (/services/industrial/)

**URL:** `https://nwestco.com/services/industrial/`

**Primary Headline:** [Needs verification]

**Key Messages:**

**Content Assessment:**

| Element | Current State | Recommendation | Priority |
|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Strategic Clarity | CONFUSING - Heavy overlap with Petroleum vertical | CONSOLIDATE into Fuel Systems | CRITICAL |
| Target Markets | Good examples (fleet, hospitals, marinas) | KEEP as market segments within Fuel Systems | HIGH |
| Service Description | Generic "unique and challenging" | REWRITE with specific examples | MEDIUM |
| Differentiation from Petroleum | None - essentially same services | ELIMINATE as separate vertical | HIGH |

**Strategic Insight:**
"Industrial" is not a separate service vertical - it's a MARKET SEGMENT within fuel systems. Industrial customers need the same services as retail petroleum customers (tanks, pumps, dispensing, compliance), just in different applications.

**Recommendation:**
**CONSOLIDATE into Fuel Systems vertical** as market segment.

**Proposed Structure:**
```
Fuel Systems
├── Retail Fuel (Gas Stations, C-Stores)
├── Commercial/Fleet Fueling
│   ├── Fleet Services ← From Industrial page
│   ├── Bulk Plants ← From Industrial page
│   ├── Fuel Terminals ← From Industrial page
│   └── Marinas ← From Industrial page
├── Aviation Fueling (Airports, FBOs)
└── Industrial Applications
    ├── Hospitals ← From Industrial page
    ├── Data Centers
    └── Rail-to-Storage ← From Industrial page
```

**Keep/Rewrite/Eliminate:**
- KEEP: Target market examples (fleet, hospitals, bulk plants, marinas)
- KEEP: "Unique and challenging requirements" positioning (but make specific)
- CONSOLIDATE: Into Fuel Systems rather than standalone vertical
- ELIMINATE: As separate navigation item
- REWRITE: Generic descriptions to specific project examples

- "Custom compartment design available"

- "Optional manways on most tanks below 5,000 gallons"

**Content Assessment:**

| Element | Current State | Recommendation | Priority |
|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Strategic Position | MISPLACED - Tanks are a PRODUCT, not a service vertical | REORGANIZE - Feature within Fuel Systems as equipment | CRITICAL |
| Technical Detail | Excellent - specs, capacities, options | KEEP all technical specifications | HIGH |
| Manufacturer Info | Good - Wilray Manufacturing highlighted | KEEP manufacturer relationship | MEDIUM |
| Application Context | Minimal - doesn't explain when/why customers need tanks | ADD - Applications and selection guidance | HIGH |

**Strategic Insight:**
Tanks are EQUIPMENT used in petroleum, aviation, and industrial projects. They're not a separate service vertical any more than "pumps" or "dispensers" would be.

**Recommendation:**
**ELIMINATE as top-level navigation item**. Feature tanks as PRODUCT OFFERING within Fuel Systems pages.

**Proposed Integration:**
- Feature on Fuel Systems main page: "Premium Tanks from Wilray Manufacturing"
- Link to detailed tank specification page (not in main nav)
- Call out on relevant service pages:
  - Petroleum: "We supply and install UL-142 tanks from 500-30,000 gallons"
  - Aviation: "Above and underground tank options with aviation-spec linings"
  - Industrial: "Custom compartment tanks for specialized applications"

**Keep/Rewrite/Eliminate:**

### Overall Content Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clear technical capabilities and manufacturer partnerships
- Good geographic coverage with 9 branches
- Training program exists (though under-documented)
- Turn-key positioning mentioned on multiple pages

**Weaknesses:**
- Generic, feature-focused copy throughout (not outcome/pain-point focused)
- Seven verticals create confusion and overlap
- Missing critical pages (About Us, Why Nwestco, Projects, Resources)

**Cross-Cutting Services (Not Top Nav):**
- Design & Engineering
- Installation & Construction
- Electrical Systems
- 24/7 Service & Maintenance
- Upgrades & Remodels

**Tier 3 - Important but Lower Priority:**
11. Resources library creation
12. Brand page reorganization (categorization)
